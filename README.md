# Risk-Modelling
Research paper on Risk Modelling - Credit Scoring using Logistic Regression
In my research paper on risk modeling, I employed Logistic Regression, a statistical technique widely used for binary classification tasks, to assess the risk associated with lending to consumers based on their financial behaviors. The dataset provided by ABC Bank contained information relevant to consumers' credit and repayment histories, serving as the foundation for my analysis.

My objective was to develop a model that evaluates the risk of granting credit, considering key factors such as the consumer's credit history and repayment history as indicators of creditworthiness. By leveraging this model, financial institutions can make informed decisions to maximize profitability and minimize losses due to fraudulent activities, ensuring that only trustworthy consumers receive credit.

Throughout this project, I applied skills in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Python programming to build and implement the risk model effectively.
